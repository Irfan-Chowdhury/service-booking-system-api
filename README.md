# üõ†Ô∏è Service Booking API System

</div>

A token-authenticated, API-based service booking platform built with Laravel. It allows customers to register, view services, and make bookings, while admins can manage services and monitor bookings.



## Features

### Authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
- Customer registration & login
- Admin login (via seeded credentials)
- Token-based authentication (Sanctum)

### User Roles
- `customer`: Can browse services and book
- `admin`: Can manage services and view all bookings

### Core Modules

#### Users
- Role-based authorization (`admin`/`customer`)
- Enum-based user roles for cleaner logic

#### Services
- CRUD API for admin
- Public listing API for customers

#### Bookings
- Customers can book a service on a specific date
- Validation: No booking in the past or duplicate booking (same date/service/user)

## Download Postman Collection & Test with Postman

#### Download :
Please download this **POSTMAN Collection File** : [Download Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uDGXVlEsNEgHBW_ri3JVDUj_TUyskIMl/view?usp=sharing)


#### Import :

1. Import the provided Postman collection into your Postman tool.
2. Setup a Environment to use the token for all API request.
3. Then click on the root folder, open the **Authorization** tab.  
    - Select **Type:** `Bearer Token` 
    - In **Token** field, just put the `environment variable`.
4. Test all the endpoints mentioned above.

## API Authentication (Sanctum)

* All API routes (except login/register) are protected by **Laravel Sanctum**.
* Use `/api/register` and `/api/login` to get an access token.
* Attach `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header for all authenticated routes.
---

<br>

<!-- 
## Rate Limiting (Throttle)
* All authenticated API requests are rate limited using Laravel‚Äôs `throttle` middleware.
* By default, a user can make **60 requests per minute**.
* If exceeded, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
* This protects the system from abuse and ensures fair usage. -->
---

<br>

<!-- ## ‚ö° Performance Notes

* To optimize reporting queries, **indexes** have been added on the `start_time` and `end_time` columns in the `time_logs` table.

  * This improves the efficiency of **date-based filtering** and **aggregation** (e.g., total hours per day/week/month).
* **Eloquent relationships are eager-loaded** where needed to avoid N+1 query problems and reduce database load.
* **Caching** has been applied to frequently accessed data:

  * All **clients** and **projects** for the authenticated user are cached per user to reduce repetitive queries.
  * **Report results** are cached based on filters like date range, client, and project to avoid heavy recomputation during repeated API hits.
* These optimizations collectively enhance API performance, especially under high traffic or large data volumes. -->
